<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The backpack backend is a service that creates a virtual backpack for your assets stored on IPFS and makes them available for third-party applications.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* npm

  Install npm as the service is based on NodeJS.
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

* Docker

  Install docker as the service requires a database for persistent storage.
  ```sh
  brew cask install docker
  ```

* Environment

  Rename the environment file and add your credentials. Environment file is read by NestJS and Docker.
  ```sh
  mv .env.example .env
  ```

* Web3.Storage account and API token

  In order to use web3.storage you need an API key. First, head over to web3.storage to login with your email address. You will receive an email with a magic link that signs you in – no password needed. After you successfully logged in, go to API Keys via the account section of the navigation bar. You will find a button to Create a new token. When prompted for an API key name, you can freely choose one or use “Backpack”. Copy the content of the key column to your .env file.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/backpack-service.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

The backpack backend consists of two components: the backend service and the database. First start the database with the following command:
```bash
# Start up the development database
$ npm run start:db
```
When the database is running, start the backend service with the following command:
```bash
# Start service in watch mode (automatically reload if files change)
$ npm run start:dev
```

There are further commands that can be used to start the backend service, e.g., for development mode without watching file changes and production mode:

```bash
# Build service in development mode and run (does not automatically reload)
$ npm run start

# Build service in production mode and run
$ npm run start:prod
```
